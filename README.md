####Notes
Everything notable which is not directly related to a location/dangers.

I found a map (http://s1073.photobucket.com/user/patrick_is_kool/media/fc0dae2f-e9b6-45c2-aa0d-88a6f531242f_zps79847b56.jpg.html?t=1378086676) but im not able to update it.
I also got a piece of info: The currently accesible area is only a small part. The full map will be 8000x12000.
